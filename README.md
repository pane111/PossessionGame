# Black Blade
A game about a living weapon possessing its owner.

You are an exorcist, locked in a castle with demonic artifacts that need to be destroyed - however, your own sword is also one such artifact and wishes to possess you.

The original prototype for this game was created in about a week, but we decided to keep working on it to bring the game to a somewhat finished state.
While the game is by no means a fully complete and polished experience, we hope you will have fun with it!
