# Black Blade
A game about a living weapon possessing its owner.

You are an exorcist, locked in a castle with demonic artifacts that need to be destroyed - however, your own sword is also one such artifact and wishes to possess you.

Originally made for the Stern32 Art Jam (https://www.stern32.xyz/post/t=Art%20Jam%2003&id=38), we decided to keep working on the game and bring it to a somewhat finished state.
